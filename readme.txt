Displays a logged-in comment author's site display name in a new column on the "Comments" admin screen.

== Description ==

The Comments User Column plugin adds an additional column to the "Comments" admin screen.  This column displays the user display name if the user was logged into the site while leaving a comment.  The display name also links to a page where you can view all of that particular user's comments.

This plugin is mostly useful for sites that have mixed comments from logged-in and logged-out (visitors) to the site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Why was this plugin created?

I needed a way to easily distinguish between guest commenters and logged-in users leaving comments. This was an easy way to see this straight from the comments screen in the admin.

### How do I use it?

It's plug-n-play. Just activate the plugin. Nothing else is required.
